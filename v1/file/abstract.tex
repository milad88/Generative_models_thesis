This thesis makes an overview on the most used architectures that have been designed to achieve generative models, and show some of the recent frameworks and algorithms in robotics applications that make use of these generative models. It presents as well how these models assisted the existing frameworks like reinforcement learning that had the lead in succession in robotics applications in the last years. The combination between generative models and reinforcement learning in problems like imitation learning and learn from demonstration has led to achieve better performing frameworks.
